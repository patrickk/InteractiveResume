# InteractiveResume

Finished interactive resume after going through the Front End Nanodegree from Udacity.com

Drafting this copy of the interactive resume helped me go over jQuery again, as well as encapsulating methods for objects. 

Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

TODO: Update with real picture and contact information, add background image to header, change font colors to be not so Halloweeny, update job description, add live links to projects and project pictures, link it to portfolio
